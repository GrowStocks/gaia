# Introduction
Himig (formerly Himig Web) is Matteu's design system for building web-based products and projects. It
helps me build products faster, make it more accessible, and deliver quality and unforgettable experiences.

## Goals
Aside from being device-agnostic, beautiful/aesthetic, and accessible, we've also had a few more goals in mind:

### Consistency
One of our goals that we want to achieve in this design system is consistency in terms of design and in user experience.
The design system should be able to deliver consistent
experiences throughout GrowStocks' wide range of digital products, regardless of any project-specific design problems it
needs to solve.

### Development Speed
When we build our products, it is important for us to not reinvent the wheel. If a tool is at your disposal, use it as
much as you can before you reach for something else. The design system should be able to provide excellent tooling for creating
interfaces in a speedy manner, this way developers won't have to exert effort into recreating components, patterns,
practices, and principles we've already made and agreed on.

### Framework Agnostic
Whether you're rendering HTML from the server using server-side code, or you're rendering client-side interfaces using Javascript, the design system should be able to cater to different tech stacks.
