# Structure Tokens
Gaia provides an extensive list of carefully crafted, pre-made structure tokens ready to go.

## Structure Token Schema
The structure tokens follow a specific schema to make indexing much easier. The tokens follow a `xs-xl` schema and extends to a `2xl-6xl` schema when needed.

The structure token schema depends on the type of structure property. For example, `border-size` tokens is different from the `spacing` and `el-spacing` tokens.
