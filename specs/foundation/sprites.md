# Sprites
Sprites are icons of in-game items. Gaia uses these to provide a better experience browsing listed items, may it be in a
price index, or a marketplace.

## Sprite Size
Sprite size is at a fixed `32px x 32px` on web interfaces. 

For graphic designers, you can fixate it at any size the
design requires as long as the quality will not degrade.
We generally recommend using an `svg` version of the sprite in this use case.
