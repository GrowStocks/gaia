# Composition API
Himig lets you compose complex components that can't be solved by utility classes alone. By using the composition API,
it lets you create components with the same API patterns as Himig's primitive components.

Here are the composition APIs you can work with:
- [Color](color.md)
- [Structure](structure.md)
- [Typography](typography.md)
